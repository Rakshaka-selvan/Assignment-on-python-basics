Q3.(i)/ is an arithmetic operator which is used to solve the arithmetic operation division.
eg)a=5
b=10
c=b/a
print(c)
2.0

Q7.Mutable data types are the data types in which their elements can be replaced,deleted,edited or changed with an other assigned element .eg for mutable data types are Lists eg)

l=[45.67,90,'single',True,7+8j]
l[2]=44
l
[45.67, 90, 44, True, (7+8j)]
l[0]='datatype'
l
['datatype', 90, 44, True, (7+8j)]
Immutable data types are the data type in which elements cannot be exchanged or replaced or edited .Sting is that type of data which cannot be altered.

s='sampletext'
s[0]=f (error)
